Amazon_Vine_Analysis



Overview



The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program, a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews of their products and determine if there are any biases between Vine members and Non-Vine member's reviews.


Companies that will pay a fee to Amazon and may provide free products to Vine members who are then required to publish a review. In order to determine if there is any bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members vs. non-members, we need to identify the percentage of 5 star ratings to total rating. As part of this exercise, we were asked to choose datasets to extract, transform and load into a dataframe in order to complete our analysis. Throughout this analysis.

Resources:

PySpark to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to AWS RDS instance and load the transformed data into pgAdmin.
Google Colab to import PySpark libraries and connect to Postgres in order to create SQL tables and export the results of the datasets.
